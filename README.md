# Splunk-alert_microsoftteams
Splunk App to send notifications to Microsoft Teams
Custom alert action to send messages to Microsoft Teams. 
Added optional field extraction to create action button in teams. If you want a custom action button add field and field name when configuring alerts.
This is a fork from alert_msteams that was written by Abhi Devireddy  who appears to have abandonded it. It has been reworked in Python3 and using requests.
